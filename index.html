                <p>In July of 2016, I packed everything I owned into a small, cheap storage unit
                    except for a tent, a sleeping bag, and a few changes of clothes and
                    set off in a borrowed car to drive around the country for several weeks.
                    I drove through 15 states, got denied entry to Canada, and slept in three Wal-Mart
                    parking lots.

                <p>I started by driving north from San Francisco. I went to a school in northern
                    California and wanted to go back for a short visit. Because really, who wouldn't
                    want to spend more time in a landscape like this?</p>

                <h2>Seattle, Washington</h2>
                <figure>

                </figure>
                <p>I drove north through Oregon, wandering through the woods, spending time in Bend
                    and Portland. Unfortunately, I forgot to get many pictures when I was there.
                    Heading north from Portland, I went out and camped on the Washington coast.
                    After a few days I found myself in Seattle. The day I went to the Space
                    Needle, Microsoft had rented out the entire structure as a welcome to their
                    new interns. I guess I'll have to go back one day.</p>

                <p>From Seattle, I tried to go into Canada to visit Vancouver, but they wouldn't
                    let me in while driving someone else's car. So instead I went to Mount Saint
                    Helens, then through Boise, then to Salt Lake City to spend a few days with
                    my dear friend Cooper.</p>

                </figure>
                <p>After I spent a few days with Cooper, I turned east and set off for St Louis.
                    It's a very long way between Salt Lake City and St Louis. From Utah, I drove across Colorado,
                    stopping to visit a ski resort my family stayed in twice many years ago. Then
                    I hung out in Boulder for a minute, because that town is amazing. Then I went through
                    Denver, which was ok. Fun fact: east of Devner, Colorado is as boring as Kanasas.</p>

                <p>From Kansas, I continued east across Missouri making a short stop in
                    the state's capital, Jefferson City. I've lived in Missouri almost
                    all my life and had necer been to the capital. Seemed a shame. I discovered
                    that our capital building is gorgeous.</p>

                <p>After almost 4 weeks on the road, I had gotten back to my childhood
                    home of St Louis, Missouri. I spent some time with my parents,
                    discovered my credit card info had been stolen and spent several
                    days without any access at all to funds, and had to replace
                    the car's windsheild. A good visit. From here, I turned south
                    to start my return.</p>

                <h2>New Orleans, Louisiana</h2>
                <figure>
                    <img src="images/NOLA.jpg" alt="The French Quarter" width=300/>
                    <figcaption>There are no open container laws in New Orleans, thus my nearly
                        empty "walking around beer."</figcaption>
                </figure>
                <p>I had wanted to see New Orleans for a couple years at this point
                    and have friend who lives there, which meant I got a bed for free.
                    We wandered around the French Quarter and an art market that I fell
                    in love with. New Orleans is a mesmerizing place.</p>

                </figure>
                <p>As I headed back towards California, I stayed south this time. From New Orleans,
                    I traversed the great, unending expanse of Texas with a short stop
                    in Austin. Then through New Mexico to visit a friend living in
                    Santa Fe for the summer. Yet another city I didn't get to spend nearly
                    enough time in.</p>

                </figure>
                <p>I surprised myself by heading into San Diego for a few days. I
                    had never really planned on going to that town, but a friend had
                    moved there a year or so prior and suggested I make a stop. It's
                    a beautiful place.</p>

                    <figcaption>That tent was a faithful companion.</figcaption>
                </figure>
                <p>This was the last camping spot I hit before I returned to civilization. In truth,
                    I could have made the trip from San Diego to Los Angeles in a couple hours,
                    but I wanted one more night alone, in my tent, in the world.
                    I even slept with the side flaps off this time.</p>

                </figure>
                <p>I made it to Los Angeles, which would be my home for the next two months.
                    It was a short stay, but a great one. I made some good friends and
                    got to experience a new city from the inside.</p>

                </figure>
                <p>I went back to SF pick up my belongings. I had to return my friend's
                    car so I rented a 12-passenger van and managed to fit everything in around
                    the seats. I visited the beach with my best friend and huddled
                    by a fire on the beach for a few hours. It was a wonderful ending
                    to a very long drive.</p>
